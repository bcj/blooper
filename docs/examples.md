# Examples

Each example can be run by running the file, passing it no arguments.
Each example will produce a `.wav` file with its same name.

## Minimal

[minimal.py](../examples/minimal.py) uses the bare-minimum number of imports required in order to produce music with Blooper (arguably one fewer than the bare-minimum as this track doesn't contain any rests).

## Rite

[rite.py](../examples/rite.py) is a (partial) conversion of a two piano arrangement of The Rite of Spring.
Blooper treats this as 4 parts as each hand is considered its own part.
This example shows off a bit more functionality of Blooper and also its limitations.
The original score is idiosyncratic enoughâ€”it is almost illegible as code.
